Read Me:

The two parts are separated by folders "part 1" and "part 2." Inside each folder lies the necessary functions and data required 
to run each respective algorithm. Also, a script is included which was used to decompose the workspace. 

To execute the Bug 1 algorithm, simply run the "Bug1_Algorithm.m" script. There is already a function which randomizes the
initial start and finish points, but you can manually specify these values as well. Also, the Bug1_Animation.m" script will
produce a gif for one path realization. To create the gif, put the generated path.mat file into the Data folder (delete the old .mat file).

For the Decomposition and Search Method algorithm, simply run the "Decomposition_and_Search.m" script. As before, the same random
function is included for initializing the start and goal points, but you can manually specify these values as well. Also, the 
"Decomposition_and_Search_Animation.m" script will produce a gif for one path realization. To create the gif, put the newly created 
.mat files (i.e., Path.mat, Roadmap.mat, and Trapezoids.mat) into the data folder (delete the old .mat files).
