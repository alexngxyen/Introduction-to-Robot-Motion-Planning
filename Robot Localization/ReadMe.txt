ReadMe:

There are two folders located in the "Matlab.zip" file which correspond to the beacon-based localization 
and SLAM localization algorithms. No functions are needed to run any of the scripts. Therefore, to test 
the localization filters just open the desired ".m" file and hit run. Although, pre-saved data is needed 
for performance comparison of the estimated trajectory plots shown in both folders. Here, the random seed 
was held constant for all simulations to provide a better baseline for performance analysis.

Edittd on June 14th, 2021:
I've updated my report and simulation files with the corrected linearized observation Jacobian Matrices. Also, new 
performance plots (RMSE, NEES, NIS, Estimation Error) were added to the scripts included in the Matlab.zip file. The 
report had its loop closure tables updated too.
